  "course_name": "Programming with Kubernetes - Learn Interactively",
  "course_overview": "Kubernetes is a popular open-source container orchestration system that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. This course is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of Kubernetes and its programming concepts. You’ll dive deep into advanced topics of Kubernetes.\n\nThis course will cover topics such as Kubernetes architecture, frameworks, plugins, and interfaces. You’ll also learn the powerful extensibilities of Kubernetes and make full use of these built-in capabilities to build your customized Kubernetes.\n\nThis course is ideal for developers, DevOps engineers, and system administrators who want to learn how to master Kubernetes. By the end of the course, you’ll have a solid understanding of Kubernetes, its programming concepts, and be able to deploy, scale, and manage containerized customizations on Kubernetes. You will also get hands-on experience extending Kubernetes to meet your requirements.",
